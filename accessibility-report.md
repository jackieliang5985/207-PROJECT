1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle.
   * Principle 1: Equitable Use
     * Adherence: The Mind Map Board Generator is designed with inclusivity in mind. The application allows for easy customization of nodes (e.g., adding text, images, and colors) which can help users of different abilities to organize their ideas effectively.
     * Future Implementation: In the future, we could add support for keyboard shortcuts, high-contrast themes, and screen reader compatibility to further ensure equitable use for users with visual impairments.
   * Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
     * Adherence: The program allows users to create, move, and delete nodes as well as change the layout to suit their preferences, offering flexibility in how the mind map is structured. Users can also customize node colors, allowing for personalization.
     * Future Implementation: We could implement more flexible ways of interacting with the mind map, such as drag-and-drop for nodes, or support for different input methods (e.g., speech-to-text).
   * Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
     * Adherence: The interface is designed to be simple, with basic tools clearly displayed, and intuitive controls for creating and organizing mind maps. The color-coded categorization and drag-and-drop features allow users to easily understand and use the program.
     * Future Implementation: We could further simplify the user experience by adding tooltips or an interactive guide for first-time users.
   * Principle 4: Perceptible Information
     * Adherence: The application provides visual feedback, such as confirmation messages after saving or exporting the mind map, and highlights elements like nodes when they are selected or moved. The interface uses different colors for categorization, enhancing visual distinction.
     * Future Implementation: We could add auditory feedback for users who are visually impaired, or provide alternative text for images to further enhance perceptibility.
   * Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
     * Adherence: The program allows users to undo or redo actions, such as adding or removing nodes, preventing mistakes from being permanent. Additionally, the program has built-in validation to ensure nodes are connected properly.
     * Future Implementation: To improve tolerance for errors, we could implement auto-save features or confirmations before deletion to prevent accidental loss of important data.
   * Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
     * Adherence: The application is designed to require minimal physical effort, as most interactions can be done via mouse (click-and-drag) without requiring complex key combinations or excessive mouse movement.
     * Future Implementation: We could implement keyboard shortcuts or voice commands for users with mobility impairments to reduce the need for mouse interactions.
   * Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
     * Adherence: The interface elements (e.g., buttons, nodes) are well-spaced to allow for easy interaction, especially when zooming in or out of the mind map. The program is responsive, allowing users to adjust the size of the canvas.
     * Future Implementation: To further adhere to this principle, we could allow users to customize the size of UI elements for better accessibility or provide options for larger interface components.

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
   * If I were to sell or license the Mind Map Board Generator, I would market it towards students, educators, and professionals in fields that require brainstorming, organizing ideas, or planning projects. More importantly, it would be pitched to high school and college students who need a visual approach for note-taking, study aids, and project planning. It would also be perfect for a teacher or educator looking to use mind maps in reorganizing course materials and visually explaining a hard topic. Professionals across marketing, design, and product development will also find value in MindMeister: for ideation, flow organization, and collaboration. This would be possible by offering customizable nodes, colors, and easy-to-use interactive features that could fit the needs of many industries requiring creative and strategic planning tools.

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
   * Being generally accessible to all demographics in nature, this program will be less likely to prove useful or easily accessible, acting as a mind-mapping tool. For example, persons with limited access to digital literacy or technology, users in underprivileged regions will either partially use the program or face other challenges in usage. Additionally, unless proper accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility and color contrast adjustment are integrated, the user interface and features may not be fully optimized for persons with disabilities, especially those with visual impairments. From an ethical standpoint, the digital divide, as discussed in our ethics modules, presents the potential exclusion of certain groups from technology-based tools. This could further marginalize these populations if the program is not inclusive or equitably accessible. For a program to be at its best, it has to be universally accessible in design, offering features that would meet diverse user needs and thus promote equal access to technology.
